# **Problem solving approaches and common patterns**  


**Problem solving approaches:**  
* Understand the problem and get all your questions(input/output) clarified.
* Work on devising a plan by breaking it down into simpler steps.
* Solve the problem. Code it.
* Checkout expected outcomes and expectations.
* Refactor your code.
